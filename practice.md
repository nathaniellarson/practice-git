let's start at the very beginning...

1. Forgot to add to commit? 
    - `git commit --amend`
    - change git message and then exit with `:wq`
2. Drop current changes?
    - `git checkout`
    - `git stash`
3. Branch name spelled wrong?
    - `git branch â€“m <old_name> <new>`
4. Merge conflict
    - `git pull origin <conflict_branch>`
    - and then resolve one-by-one
